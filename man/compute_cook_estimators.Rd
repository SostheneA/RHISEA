\title{Compute Cook Estimators for Stock Proportions}
\usage{
compute_cook_estimators(class_predictions, PHIinv, np)
}
\arguments{
\item{class_predictions}{A numeric vector of predicted class (stock) labels for the mixed sample.
Values should be integers from 1 to \code{np}.}

\item{PHIinv}{The inverse of the misclassification matrix (Phi).
Dimensions should be np x np.}

\item{np}{Integer, the number of populations (stocks).}
}
\value{
A list containing three numeric vectors:
\item{raw}{Raw proportions of classification.}
\item{cook}{Cook's corrected estimates.}
\item{cook_constrained}{Cook's constrained estimates (non-negative, sum to 1).}
}
\description{
Computes three types of estimators based on classification results:
\enumerate{
\item Raw proportions: Simple proportion of samples classified to each stock.
\item Cook's corrected estimator: Raw proportions corrected by the inverse of the
misclassification matrix (Phi_inv). This can result in negative estimates.
\item Cook's constrained estimator: An iterative adjustment of Cook's corrected
estimator to ensure proportions are non-negative and sum to 1.
