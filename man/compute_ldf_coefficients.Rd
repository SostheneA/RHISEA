\title{Compute Linear Discriminant Function (LDF) Coefficients}
\usage{
compute_ldf_coefficients(baseline)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseline}{A list of numeric matrices, where each matrix represents the
baseline (training) data for one population/stock.
Each matrix should have observations as rows and variables as columns.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of LDF coefficients. Rows correspond to populations,
and columns correspond to variables followed by the constant term.
The dimensions are (np x (nv + 1)).
}
\description{
Computes the coefficients for Fisher's Linear Discriminant Function for each
group (population/stock). This implementation assumes a common (pooled)
covariance matrix across all groups, a standard assumption for LDA.
The LDF is of the form: LDF_j(x) = C_j0 + C_j1\emph{x1 + ... + C_jp}xp.
}
\examples{
# Create dummy baseline data for 2 stocks with 2 variables
stock1_data <- matrix(rnorm(20, mean = 0), ncol = 2)
stock2_data <- matrix(rnorm(20, mean = 1), ncol = 2)
baseline_list <- list(StockA = stock1_data, StockB = stock2_data) # Named list
ldf_coeffs <- compute_ldf_coefficients(baseline_list)
print(ldf_coeffs)
