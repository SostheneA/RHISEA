\title{Simulate a Mixed Fishery Sample from Known Stock Proportions}
\usage{
simulate_mixture(baseline_data_list, actual_proportions, N_mixture_size)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseline_data_list}{A list of numeric matrices. Each matrix represents the
baseline (standard) data for one stock/population, with
observations as rows and variables as columns.}

\item{actual_proportions}{A numeric vector of true proportions for each stock in the mixture.
Must sum to 1 and have the same length as \code{baseline_data_list}.}

\item{N_mixture_size}{Integer, the total number of individuals to draw for the synthetic mixture.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix representing the simulated mixture sample. Rows are
individuals, and columns are variables. Returns an error if the mixture
cannot be formed (e.g., due to empty baseline stocks needed for sampling).
}
\description{
Creates a synthetic fishery mixture by sampling individuals from different baseline
stocks according to specified true proportions. Sampling from each stock is done
with replacement.
}
\examples{
# Dummy baseline data
stock1 <- matrix(rnorm(20 * 2, mean = 0, sd = 1), ncol = 2) # Assuming 2 variables
stock2 <- matrix(rnorm(30 * 2, mean = 2, sd = 1), ncol = 2) # Assuming 2 variables
baseline_list_ex <- list(stock1, stock2)
true_props_ex <- c(0.6, 0.4) # 60\% from stock1, 40\% from stock2
mixture_N_ex <- 100
# simulated_sample_ex <- simulate_mixture(baseline_list_ex, true_props_ex, mixture_N_ex)
# print(head(simulated_sample_ex))
# print(nrow(simulated_sample_ex)) # Should be close to 100
