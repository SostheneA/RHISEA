\title{Classify Samples Using LDF Coefficients}
\usage{
classify_samples(samples, coefs, freq = NULL, type = "S")
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{A numeric matrix of samples to be classified.
Rows are observations, columns are variables.}

\item{coefs}{A numeric matrix of LDF coefficients, as returned by
\code{compute_ldf_coefficients}. Rows are populations, columns are
coefficients for variables followed by the constant term.}

\item{freq}{Optional numeric vector of frequency weights for the samples.
Defaults to 1 for each sample if NULL. (Used mainly for HISEA compatibility).}

\item{type}{Character, indicates the type of run (e.g., "S" for simulation).
This parameter is from HISEA Fortran and affects a condition for processing,
though its impact here is minor if \code{freq} are positive. Default "S".}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\item{class}{An integer vector of predicted class labels (1 to NP) for each sample.}
\item{likelihood}{A numeric matrix where rows are samples and columns are
populations. Contains posterior probabilities of class membership
(assuming equal priors, rows sum to 1).}
}
\description{
Assigns each sample (observation) to a population/stock based on the highest
Linear Discriminant Function (LDF) score. It also computes posterior
probabilities (or values proportional to them if priors are not explicitly used).
